		<p><b>The Markup Validator </b>is a free service by W3C that helps check 
		the validity of Web documents.</p>
		<p>Most Web documents are written using markup languages, such as HTML or 
		XHTML. These languages are defined by technical specifications, which usually
		include a machine-readable formal grammar (and vocabulary). The act of 
		checking a document against these constraints is called validation, and 
		this is what the Markup Validator does.
