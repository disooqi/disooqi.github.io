  WISE is a scalable natural language platform for querying RDF-based graphs. WISE
  proposes a novel three-phase strategy to transform a natural language question into a SPARQL query.
  WISE uses NLP and semantic affinity models trained independently of the targeted RDF
  graphs, i.e., there is no need for prior knowledge of the graph or redo the pre-processing.
