description: >
    Natasy is an Arabic word means a skilled scientist, or a clever doctor. Natasy designed and
    developed to be both easy to use and source code readable. It a straightforward
    implementation of different algorithms and techniques of machine &amp; Deep learning in
    Python. Backpropagation is implemented in boring detail such that derivative steps is
    taken carefully and without any implicit or hidden details. It is implemented in pure Python
    (i.e. only NumPy is used for numerical computations). You can use it for small projects
    and/or educational purposes.
