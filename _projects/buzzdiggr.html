                I worked on Buzzdiggr project at Online Modern Solution (OMS) company as a senior software engineer at
                the R&amp;D team for 1 year starting from.

            </p>
            <p style="">
                The aim of the project is to provide a platform for businesses and/or government entities that they can use to monitor social
                media and the Web for different purposes such as measure user satisfaction, early warning alarms, expand their
                campaigns in the weak geographical spots. The platform includes many tools to analyse the stream of tweets, posts and news
                articles from different websites and help making and taking decision about it through a wide spectrum of graphs and statistical tools.

            </p>
            <p>
                As part of the Research &amp; Development team, I was responsible to transfer and maintain the state-of-the-art science and technologies
                in the field of Topic detection, Named-entity Recognition, Sentiment analysis, and Arabic Dialects Identifications. I contributed to
                the project as follows:

            <p class="">

                    <!--You need to talk more about the data set by statistics (number and tables): inter-annotation agreement-->
                    I have provide the dataset for building Sentiment Analyzer, Named-Entity Recognizer, and dialect
                identification through 1) collecting tweets, posts and web articles 2) managing the annotation process and
                the annotators, 3) controlling quality by assuring that data is covering certain criteria such as particular
                dialects, balanced in its sentiment, covering particular regions and countries, and finally 4) controlling
                quality by maintaining a minimum threshold for inter-annotation agreement.

            </p>

            <p class="">
                In addition to providing the data, I have conducting research building both Sentiment Analyzer and Named-Entity Recognizer.
                For Sentiment analyses, I considered five sentiments, namely positive, strongly positive, negative, strongly negative, and
                neutral. The research focus was on two folds 1) constructing appropriate feature representations of tweets and posts, and
                2) entity linking to identify all tweets, posts, and news articles that belong to the brand we analyse.
