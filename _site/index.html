<!--My name is Mohamed Eldesouki Mohamed. I am writing this letter as part of the online application to the PhD program in Computer Science and Engineering at HBKU to express my interest to be part of the program. </p>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--Currently I am working as a Research Associate at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), HBKU. Joining such prestigious research institute contributed substantially in crafting my research personality. It gave me the opportunity to learn the craft of research through participating on publishing in the top-tier conferences and through developing the state-of-the-art technologies in the field of Arabic Language Technologies. At QCRI, I have firsthand experience of what first-class research is like. Discussions with scientists and researchers, and working within joint projects with other best universities and research centers; such as MIT and CMU outside and inside Qatar, has drawn the path that I should take to be one of the top-notch researchers one day. I was always dreaming to be in such place and I hope to continue being part of this community by being accepted for the PhD position.</p>-->

<!--Let me tell you more about my achievements at QCRI. I have participated in the research and development process of building FARASA; the-state-of-the-art Arabic language Segmenter, POS tagger, Parser and Diacritizer. After that I started working with Dialectal Arabic, I led the work in the DSL Shared Task 2016 of the VarDial 2016 workshop for Arabic Dialect Identification and achieved the BEST ACCURACY. Continuing working with Dialectal Arabic, I participated in developing word segmenter for the Egyptian Dialect using deep NN-based approach namely bi-LSTM and I got two papers accepted in the WANLP2017 co-located with EACL 2017. Please refer to my CV for more details about my work at QCRI.-->

              Arabic  dialects  do  not  just  share  a  common  koińe, but  there  are  shared  pan- dialectal linguistic phenomena that allow computational models for dialects to learn from  each  other.   In  this  paper  we  build a  unified  segmentation  model  where  the training   data   for   different   dialects   are combined  and  a  single  model  is  trained. The  model  yields  higher  accuracies  than dialect-specific  models,   eliminating  the need for dialect identification before seg- mentation.   We  also  measure  the  degree of  relatedness  between  four  major  Ara- bic  dialects  by  testing  how  a  segmenta- tion model trained on one dialect performs on the other dialects.   We found that lin- guistic relatedness is contingent with ge- ographical proximity.  In our experiments we use SVM-based ranking and bi-LSTM- CRF sequence labeling.

              In this paper we focus on the problem of question ranking in community question answering (cQA) forums in Arabic. We address the task with machine learning algorithms using advanced Arabic text representations. The latter are obtained by applying tree kernels to constituency parse trees combined with textual similarities, including word embeddings. Our two main contributions are: (i) an Arabic language processing pipeline based on UIMA—from segmentation to constituency parsing—built on top of Farasa, a state-of-the-art Arabic language processing toolkit; and (ii) the application of long short-term memory neural networks to identify the best text fragments in questions to be used in our tree-kernel-based ranker. Our thorough experimentation on a recently released cQA dataset shows that the Arabic linguistic processing provided by Farasa produces strong results and that neural networks combined with tree kernels further boost the performance in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our approach also enables an implicit comparison between different processing pipelines as our tests on Farasa and Stanford parsers demonstrate.
